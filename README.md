How do you troubleshoot common Linux server issues?

Here is the Answer :
.
1. Check system logs

Logs contain crucial information about the system's state. Check the system and application logs for any error messages.

# Check system logs on Ubuntu

# Check application logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log

2. Check disk space

If the system is running low on disk space, it can lead to various issues.

# Check available disk space
df -h

# Check inodes
df -i

4. Check network connectivity

Check network connectivity and firewall rules.

# Check ping

5. Check process status

Check the status of running processes and kill any unresponsive or stalled processes.

# Check process status

6. Update software

Ensure that your system is up-to-date, as outdated software can lead to security vulnerabilities and system issues.

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

7. Restart services

Restarting services can resolve many issues.

# Restart Nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx

# Restart MySQL
sudo systemctl restart mysql

In summary, to troubleshoot common Linux server issues:
